# Machine Learning 2: Model selection and validation

These are the materials for the second lecture on machine learning,
which will take place on Thursday, May 4 in the afternoon.

The main focus is how to properly evaluate machine learning models
and perform hyperparameter selection,
using tools from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

We will also discuss regularization and dimensionality reduction,
so that we have examples of hyperparameters to tune and more complex learning pipelines.

To run the exercises we need python 3.7 or newer and the packages listed in
`exercises/requirements.txt` -- if you followed the [setup instructions](https://neurodatascience.github.io/QLS612-Overview/setup.html) on
the course website you have all this already.

Here are the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12JWfc2RN54hu2oCTkM8GWwPFs49m8WK_VcM8rkeWpjI/edit?usp=sharing) for the lecture
and during the lecture we will regularly pause to edit
and execute scripts found in `exercises`.

This lecture will be taught
by [Jérôme Dockès](https://jeromedockes.github.io/)
and [Nikhil Bhagwat](https://nikhil153.github.io/).
