# Introduction to Python

**Instructor:** Michelle

Welcome to **Module 3: Introduction to Python**! üêç

In this module, we will cover the fundamentals of the Python programming language:
syntax, data structures, functions, and more.

Lecture material (an interactive notebook) can be found in `lecture`,
and I have posted tutorial exercises in the `exercises` folder.
Exercise solutions will be posted at a later date in the course.

All the material for this module is modified from last year's version of the course.
