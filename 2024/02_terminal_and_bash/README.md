# Terminal and Bash

**Instructor:** Brent & Alyssa

Hi everyone!

Welcome to the module on Terminal and Bash.

Here you will find the Jupyter Notebooks and PDFs for the module content and exercises,
and a couple of directories that hold the resources for them.

For the smoothest learning experience,
we recommend that you use the PDFs or Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)
to follow along with the lecture and exercise instructions as needed,
but **run all commands in a terminal** (i.e., not from inside the `.ipynb` files).

The material was originally prepared by Sebastian Urchs from our lab
and has been previously taught by Jacob Sanz-Robinson.

I'm Brent and will be covering "Terminal and Bash" and the HPC course this year.

Enjoy! :)
