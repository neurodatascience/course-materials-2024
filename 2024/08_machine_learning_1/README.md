## Before the in-class tutorial

1. Run the [setup_test](exercises/env-setup_test.py) to ensure you have
   the correct python environment setup. Here are the detailed
   [installation instructions](https://neurodatascience.github.io/QLS612-Overview/setup/setup.html)
   to make sure you have all these requirements.

## In-class tutorial

1. We will go over the slides and answer your questions.
2. Go through the simple [ML_regression](exercises/ML_Regression_Tutorial.py) example and a [ML_classificaiton](exercises/ML_Classification_Tutorial.ipynb) example on an autism dataset.
